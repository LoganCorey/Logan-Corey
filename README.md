# Logan-Corey

My own personal website built with React, Redux, SCSS and Typescript available at https://www.logancorey.ca!

# About The Project

I always wanted to create my own personal website but whenever I tried I was never too happy with the end result. After some time of thinking about what I really wanted to do I decided that instead of creating a website for someone else (employers) I wanted to create something for myself. This gave me the idea to create my website as a browse page because previously I was focusing all my attention onto how I wanted people to look at my projects (browse) instead of focusing on enjoying myself and being creative.

One of the major goals of this project was to keep things as simple while remaining modern. As a result this project makes use of React and Redux with Typescript while not having a fully featured backend. To get around the contact form issue I ended up using a EmailJS to send the emails.
