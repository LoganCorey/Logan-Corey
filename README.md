# Logan-Corey

My own personal website built with React, CSS and Typescript available at https://www.logancorey.ca!

# About The Project

I always wanted to create my own personal website but whenever I tried I was never too happy with the end result.   As a result I decided to make this a living project where I go through different ideas continually improving upon what ever kind of design I feel like is better or more interesting.  This website has gone through many iterations (a more artistic design with moving particles to an online store themed site to what it is now).  One of the major goals with this project is to treat it as a time capsule for my own personal improvement regarding design and coding ideas.
