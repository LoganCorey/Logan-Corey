Luckily, the audio from a pptx file is easily recoverable and Python had a library called PyDub which uses ffmpeg to combine the audio files into one made this project not as challenging.  In order to increase the challenge I decided to create this project as a web  app and in the process learend about dealing with files over the web and how to store / remove them from the server once the user got what they wanted.",
